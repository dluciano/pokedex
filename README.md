The project description can be founded here: [Challenge](https://github.com/honeypotio/challenge)
The pokedex is a challange I founded in github and it's a brilliant way to learn Angular and other concepts. Main knowledge applied in this project are: convert an image to a functional web page, use of frontend libraries and technologies: SASS, HTML5, Angular 6. Also CI/CD, and DRY was used because I started the project from a template of Angular with a huge amount of already done solutions (integration to jenkis, e2e with protractor, angular 6, webpack, and so on). 

Tech stack:
* Angular 6
* NPM
* Travis CI
* Docker
* Typescript
* TSLint
* Karma
* Jasmine
* Protractor
* Webpack
* Git/Github
* Polyfills
* Serverless/SPA/Pokeapi

Screens: The pokeapi proxy service is down :( I will upload it later when I implement the JS wrapper of the pokedex api or if the proxy server go online again. Nonetheless, it looks like the screens in the challange.
